within
======
Run a command in other directories:

**within** [**-j** *jobs*] *directories* **-** *command*

Description
-----------
Runs the given *command* in all given *directories*,
prepending directory names to output:

    $ within msort trickle - make clean
    msort: rm -f *.o msort
    trickle: rm -f trickle tritty

When a single directory is given the **--** may be omitted:

    $ within code/msort git status
    code/msort: nothing to commit, working tree clean

The **-j** option specifies how many commands may be run simultaneously.
The default is 1.

Implementation
--------------
Based around a select() event loop. As many jobs are started as **-j** allows
(1 by default), forking, descending into the given directory and executing
the command. For each job, both standard output and standard error are
redirected to a pipe that's read by a 'piper' which adds the 'directory:'
prefixes to the output. These pipers are effectively coroutines.

The event loop waits for finished jobs, starting new ones if there are
directories left, and for data on the pipes.

The select() specific code should be fairly easy to swap out. Point in
case, originally kqueue was used.

Running
-------
Should work with any Unix, including Linux and macOS.
